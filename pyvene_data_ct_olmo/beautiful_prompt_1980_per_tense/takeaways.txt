The probability of was/were at layers 6-15 is greater than 5%. Meanwhile, for "is/are", the probabilities stay below 5% (and 10x less than that for "will"). This suggests that using the hidden state and attention from the year, past the 6th or 7th token, contributes greatly to the grammatical understanding of the sentence. The much higher probability of was/were also suggests that, around layer 8 or 9, there might be an understanding of the sentence's use of time in relation to the model's "current" time understanding.
