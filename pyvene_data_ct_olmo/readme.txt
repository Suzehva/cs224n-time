what the folders titles/etc mean:

"default" vs "relative" -- whether the graphs subtract out the other tenses or not

"backwards / bkw"  -- the year is placed towards the beginning of the prompt instead of towards the end

"years" -- i sweep over years

"tenses" -- i sweep over tenses (makes sense for default)

"tense of the year" -- makes sense for relative -- the relative tense is wrt the tense of the year (2005-2025 is considered "present"=is/are)

"beautiful" -- refers to the prompt: "in 1980 on a beautiful day there __"
