notes:

was/were
"in 1980 there" and "as of 1980 it"  both have the highest probabilities of was/were shoot up towards the last layers of the last token.
"in 2000 there" also has probability of "was" shoot up, relative to other tense words, at the 2000 token. All other graphs are very similar to 1980
2020 beautiful likes was/were  (focus on the year token's last layers)

is/are
all 2020, except for 2020_beautiful. the probabilities for is/are look very similar to was/were probabilities in 1980 and 2000
2050 rainy, beautiful, and asof    
 - looking at 2050 beautiful under the default_runs_years_prompts, one can see that, most of it 

will
2050 gloomy and rainy look alright
2050 there looks utterly chaotic.. whats going on :cry:
