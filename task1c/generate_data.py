# TASK 1C:
# LM input: "Tell me about Wi-Fi. The year is", "Tell me about washboards. The year is",
# etc. We will ask the LM questions about items/events from different time periods, take
# the hidden state used to generate the first token (which should be a year), and compare
# the hidden stateâ€™s similarity with embeddings of all year tokens to plot a similarity
# distribution over all years we consider (i.e. 1800 - 2024). This will help us decipher
# which years the LM uses to describe a time-tied object.
